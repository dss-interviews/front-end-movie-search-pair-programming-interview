# Movie Finder

A movie search application built with Fresh framework, Deno, using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Search for movies by name and year using a simple local data API.

[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/) is a modern TypeScript runtime with built-in security, package management, and tooling.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Deno
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)

```

### 2. Clone and Run
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Start the app
deno task start

# Run tests
deno task test
```

**Note:** The development server runs with full permissions (`-A`) for Fresh framework functionality.

### 5. Open in Browser
